## What is motivating me to change my career?

I was totally exhausted and uninspired in my previous career. As the pandemic hit, I got some time to reflect.

I really like problem solving and puzzles. I like creating things. I'm capable of working long hours, but I know longer want 12 or 15 hour days. Work/life balance sounds dreamy.

I want to create something to help or educate others. I want make learning fun.
